# TTS-Hero
Our text-to speech (TTS) function will help those that have visual and reading impairments, as well as help those who have dyslexia, 
and are low literacy readers. TTS allows them to see how words are spelled as they are read out loud, as well as help those that learn 
better from hearing things rather than reading them.
