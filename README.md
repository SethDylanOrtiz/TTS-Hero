# TTS-Hero
Our text-to speech (TTS) function will help those that have visual and reading impairments, <br> 
as well as help those who have dyslexia, and are low literacy readers. TTS allows them to see <br> 
how words are spelled as they are read out loud, as well as help those that learn better from <br>
hearing things rather than reading them.
